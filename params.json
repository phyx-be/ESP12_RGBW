You'll notice an option for a temperature sensor, bi-directional buffer and pluggable terminal block. More info regarding these options are listed below.\r\n\r\n#### Internal LEDs\r\n\r\nDefault use with either 3, 6 or 9 RGBW LEDs soldered on the bottom side of the PCB. Requires a 12V DC power source. Don't forget to double the resistor values hen using 10mA RGBW LEDs instead of the 20mA LEDs as intended.\r\n\r\n#### External LED strips\r\n\r\nIf you want to drive external RGB or RGBW LED strip you'll have to solder the pluggable terminal block for and you don't need to solder the DC jack and the internal LEDs. If you do opt for a combination of internal and external LEDs, don't forget to match the working voltage of both. By default the internal LEDs require a working voltage of 12V DC.\r\n\r\n#### Temperature sensor\r\n\r\nYou can choose either a 1-Wire [DS18B20](http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18B20.html) temperature sensor or a I2C controlled [Ti TMP112](http://www.ti.com/product/TMP112) temperature sensor. The TMP112 has an higher accuracy.\r\n\r\n#### Bi-directional buffer.\r\n\r\nSoldering the dual channel bi-directional buffer [TXB0102](http://www.ti.com/product/txb0102) makes it possible for the board to control digital LED strips and strings. This buffer requires a 5V reference which can be created by an internal 5V LDO or by supplying the board with 5V and placing a 0R resistor over the input and output pin of the LDO. Using this option you can no longer add the T1 and T2 FETs, hereby loosing 2 PWM or I/O channels.\r\n\r\n## Rev 01\r\n\r\n![ESP12_RGBW_01_T](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_01/3D_VIEW_TOP.png)\r\n![ESP12_RGBW_01_B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_01/3D_VIEW_BOT.png)\r\n\r\nThis board is a low cost version of the initial board. The main differences include a cheaper power supply, cheaper DC jack and cheaper FETs. This is done whilst trying to maintain as much veratilaty as the initial version. Although you're no longer able to connect a LED strip directly to this board, you do get access to the PWM signals on a 2.54mm header. The max input voltage is now 15V instead of 26. The option for the 5V level translator and temperature sensor have stayed the same. There is an added option for a panasonic [EKMC1601113](http://na.industrial.panasonic.com/products/sensors/sensors-automotive-industrial-applications/pir-motion-sensor-papirs/series/vz-series/2481) PIR motion sensor. The Uart connector now also has the reset and boot signals which allows us to program the boards with a bed of nails. The same signals are available on a 1mm pitch JST header.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Cheaper DC-DC power supply based on the Ti [TPS562209](http://www.ti.com/product/TPS562209)\r\n- Added [EKMC1601113](http://na.industrial.panasonic.com/products/sensors/sensors-automotive-industrial-applications/pir-motion-sensor-papirs/series/vz-series/2481) PIR footprint\r\n- Reduced board size\r\n- Reduced BoM cost\r\n- Smaller DC Jack\r\n\r\n## Example use\r\n\r\nThis board was designed to be used with the [PWM_RGBW branch](https://github.com/area3001/esp8266_lifx/tree/pwm_rgbw) of the [ESP8266_LIFX](https://github.com/area3001/esp8266_lifx) project from [Area 3001](https://github.com/area3001/)\r\n\r\n![ex_gr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_00/example_green.jpg)\r\n\r\n![ex_01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_01/IMG_LIT.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Assembly pictures\r\n\r\n![assy_t](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_01/IMG_ASSY_TOP.jpg)\r\n\r\n![assy_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_01/IMG_ASSY_BOT.jpg)\r\n\r\n![assy_rgbw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_01/IMG_RGBW.jpg)\r\n\r\n![ex_t](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_01/IMG_TOP.jpg)\r\n\r\n![ex_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/ESP12_RGBW/master/ESP12_RGBW_01/IMG_BOT.jpg)",
